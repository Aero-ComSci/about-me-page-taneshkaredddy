  <ol>
    <li>Completeion of dance</li>

  </ol>
  <p>My plans to acheive this goal is to have an organized schedule and effecient time management so that I can accomplish everything in the alloted time. Currently, I don't have a set career pathway, tehre are so many careers which interest me right now and i am going to use the rest of my freshman year to figure out what I really want to do. “Choose a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life.” I want to take my time to choosing what my future would look like because I don't want to have any regrets in the future.</p>
